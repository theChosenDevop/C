## C Code Challenge

* This is daily drill to keep up with concepts of C, shell and others
1. Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer. For example
	`Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2`
	`Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345`

2. After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).
